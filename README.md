serpent_libs
============

Libraries for the Serpent programming language.

This is intended to be a growing collection of useful libraries for the Serpent programming language. Right now, only a small strings library and a JSON parser / stringifier is implemented.

Bug reports, feature requests, pull requests are all welcomed and encouraged!

To use, simply copy all files in the src/ directory into your SERPENTPATH. A better installation is planned.
